Provides an interactive shell aka console inside your doctest case.
    
The console looks exact like in a doctest-case and you can copy and paste
code from the shell into your doctest. It feels as you are in the test case 
itself. Its not pdb, it's a python shell. 

In your doctest you can invoke the shell at any point by calling::
        
    >>> interact( locals() )        

To make your testrunner interlude aware following is needed:

1) import interlude

2) suite = DocFileSuite( ..., globs=dict(interact=interlude.interact), ...)
